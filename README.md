cafebabe
========

cafebabe is a simple parser for .class files, which are generated by the javac compiler and other compilers targeting the JVM.
This project is still a work in progress; the goal is to fully implement everything described in Chapter 4 of the JVM spec, which basically covers parsing and validation of a .class file.

Why is the project called cafebabe? Because the first 4 bytes in any valid class file are a magic identifier with the value 0xCAFEBABE.
